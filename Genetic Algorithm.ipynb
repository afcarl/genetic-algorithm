Crossover determines how to combine two (or more, although this implementation does not allow for this) individuals. Selection determines what parents to use for breeding. We select the same amount of parents as the population size, but certain individuals will be parents multiple times while other will not be. Selection determines how to select them, and is usually based on just the fitness function but it can also take other factors in consideration, like variety."
